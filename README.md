# Secret Scribe

This is a simple tool by Middlemarch to ethscribe secret messages based on work by zacque.eth.

Enter a secret message and password and click "Ethscribe." The resulting ethscription will be a self-contained HTML page containing the encrypted message, decryption logic, and a field to enter the password to automatically decrypt the message. You will get a preview as you type and can try entering your password yourself to see if it works.
